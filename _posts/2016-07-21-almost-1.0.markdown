Howdy all!

Tomorrow (July 22nd, 2016) at 10am PST, Starbound 1.0 is due to release (read about it [here](http://playstarbound.com/starbound-release-announcement/)... though lets be honest, if you're here, you already know about this.)

Over the past few months, I've been busying myself with trying to bring StarryPy3K up to speed with the nightly and unstable builds, in preparation for the 1.0 release. This has been largely successful, with the core system working extremely well. While not all the features that were previously available in StarryPy are available in the current 3K version, quite a lot of them are. Planet protections, Roles and Colorized names, chat time-stamps, Message of the Day greeters and IRC bot are all already in there. I will continue working over the next few weeks to bring over other features like backups, new player item packs, Discord bot, chat emotes to name a few. If there is something you're really interested in seeing, open an issue on GitHub and let me know.

The plan is to Sunset the original StarryPy code, and focus energy only on StarryPy3k from now on. This is being done for a number of reasons, but most importantly because switching from a Twisted to an AsyncIO back-end has given us quite a bit of a performance bump. Additionally, since Python 3.4, AsyncIO is now in-the-box with Python, meaning it is even easier than before for people to spin up a StarryPy instance.

For the time being, all development work for StarryPy3K is being done through my [personal GitHub repo](https://github.com/kharidiron/StarryPy3k), but will eventually be pushed to the Core project Repo once most the work is done. For those adventurous individuals who wish to try out the development code, I highly welcome the input for bugs and suggestions. :)

See you space cowboy...
