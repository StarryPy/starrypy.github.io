Howdy all!

As many of you have noticed, StarryPy has been lacking in updates (both 
recently, and in general) largely due to a busy life and dwindling community.
Regardless, we are still here, and the project is still active (I promise).

That said, one thing I've been wanting to do for a while now, is provide 
StarryPy with website to act as a more information-centric landing page. This 
is the first step in that effort. It ain't much to look at right now, I know, 
but give it some time.

As always, you can find us on the Freenode IRC server in the ##starrypy channel,
where we are happy to answer your questions. If there is a delay in response,
I appologize, but real work comes first. We'll get back to you as soon as we
can.

See you space cowboy...
