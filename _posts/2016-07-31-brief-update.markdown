Hey all, just a brief update on the state of StarryPy; I'm still working to get it ship-shape for 1.0. I've made a lot of progress on getting features added in and bugs squashed... but there is still quite a bit to do before I throw the 1.0 stamp on it. 

Feel free to follow my progress on my [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/kharidiron/StarryPy3k/issues) or this linked [Kanban board](https://waffle.io/kharidiron/StarryPy3k). Also please make suggestions or post your own bugs, and help me to make this wrapper excellent!

See you space cowboy...
