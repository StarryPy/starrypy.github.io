After takings some time away from the code for personal life reasons, I've figured it is time to get back into the swing of things. Starting with the low-hanging fruit of our web presence! Hence, a new post, a new page, and some minor updates.

I've gone through and tagged our previous "releases" for SP3K (really, it is more like "updates" as they are commits that bring us back to a functional status). Going forward, I'm hoping to be more professional-like in using feature branches and consistent tagging... we'll see how that goes.

Many thanks to @medeor413, @GermaniumSystem, and @dopeghoti for all their recent contributions and patches. This has brought back many of the features from the old StarryPy, as well as provided many new and useful features.

Here's hoping 2017 provides for some more awesomness (and better stability).

See you space cowboy...
